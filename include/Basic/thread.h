\brief Is an object that faciliates many threads to wait for something to
happen.

  Usage:
  
  From the working thread
  1. lock()
     You will now be the only one allowed to check weather condition is true
     (e.g. if new work has arrived).
     
  2. Check condition. If false, call wait(). You will now sleep until someone
     calls signal(); If you are awakened, check the condition again and go back
     to sleep if it is false.
     
  3. If condition is true, unLock() and start working. When finished working
     go back to 1.

  It is wise to put an exit flag in the loop, so it's possible to say that we
  are about to quit.
  
  From the manager:
  When you want to change the condition:
  1. lock
  2. set condition (e.g. add more work)
  3. signal
  4. unLock
