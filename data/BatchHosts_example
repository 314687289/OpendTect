-- Remote shell: Should be rsh or ssh
--
--Remote shell: rcmd
Remote shell: rsh
--
-- Default 'nice' level should hardly ever not be 19.
--
Default nice level: 19
--
-- Every MM Batch process will use a socket. The port number will be
-- assigned, and incremented until a free port is found.
--
First port: 37500
--
-- Needed for/on win32 only. The host+share where the data is 
-- stored. With the values in this example, the following commands
-- would be executed on a client just before executing a processing job:
-- 
--  net use "\\dgb103" mypass "/USER:dgb27/<username>"
--  net use w: "\\dgb103\dw2k"
--
-- Note: The first net use is also executed just before issueing a
--       rcmd command.
--
-- This would make the share "dw2k" on host "dgb103" available as drive w:
-- All this is done by the script "od_prepare.bat", which can be found
-- in the "bin" directory under the program installation directory.
--
-- In the case of a simple network, you don't need to change anything
-- to this script, but you can make your own version of this script
-- if you need to do some special things in order to connect the
-- network drive. In that case, you can simply make a copy of this
-- script in one of the directories listed in the manual under 
-- "Location of Program data files".
--
Data host: dgb103
Data drive: w
Data share: dw2k
Data pass: mypass
--
-- Mapping from unix to windows paths
--
-- These are prefixes used to translate windows path to unix paths, in
-- order to facilitate cross platform multi-machine processing.
--
-- In case Win32 paths are entered for application or data prefixes, use
-- a ';' instead of a ':' to separate drive from path, like:
--   c;\Program Files\OpendTect
--
Win appl prefix: c;\Program Files\OpendTect
Win data prefix: w;\OpendTect
Unx appl prefix: /users/arend/work
Unx data prefix: /dw2k/OpendTect
!
--
-- The list of hosts that are available for batch processing.
--
-- Format is:
--
-- real_hostname: name_in_user_displays [: platform] [: appl pref] [:data pref]
--
-- The user display hostnames must be unique. If you omit them,
-- the real hostname will be used for user display.
--
-- The [platform] _must_ be set to "win" for win32 machines, 
-- even if they are used in a windows-only network.
