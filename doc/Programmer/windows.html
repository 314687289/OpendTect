<a name=external><h2>External installations</h2></a>

<p> The external installations can, in principle, be installed wherever
you like. However, it is recommended to use the defaults. Otherwise, one
or two configuration files might have to be hand-edited. </p>

<p>If you choose to install some of the external installations
elsewhere, it is strongly recommended to make sure that there are no
spaces in any paths to external installations, because the make
environment has not been prepared to handle these.</p> 

<h3>Cygwin</h3>

<p>The make system that is used with OpendTect requires some tools like
a Unix-shell, sed, awk, etc. Since Cygwin provides all this, we use
Cygwin as our shell/work environment, while still creating native
Windows executables.</p>


<h4>Preparing the cygwin installation</h4>

<p> Make sure OpendTect is <b>NOT</b> running when you install Cygwin!
</p>

<p> Use the 'Install Cygwin' utility from the windows start menu to
install Cygwin. <b>Use this utility!</b> Installing Cygwin in a 'normal'
way (via the cygwin web-site for example) may fail when you have
previously run OpendTect on your system - this is because OpendTect has
changed the Windows registry in case Cygwin was not pre-installed on the
system. </p>

<p> When you are sure the registry is ok, you can also download the
Cygwin installer from <a href="http://cygwin.com">http://cygwin.com</a>
and run it. </p>

<h4>Running the cygwin installer</h4>

<p>After a few questions, you can select packages to install. Choose at
least the following packages:

<ul>
<b>Development</b>
<ul>
<li>make
<li>gcc
<li>gcc-g++
<li>gcc-mingw
</ul>
<b>Interpreters</b>
<ul>
<li>perl
<li>gawk
</ul>
<b>Shells</b>
<ul>
<li>tcsh
</ul>
</ul>

Note that some packages (like gcc-mingw-core and gcc-mingw-g++) are
automatically selected when these packages are selected - don't
de-select those dependencies.</p>

<p>
Recommended:
<ul>
<b>Development</b>
<ul>
<li>cvs</li>
<li>binutils</li>
<li>bison (*)</li>
<li>flex (*)</li>
<li>doxygen</li>
</ul>
<b>Editors</b>
<ul>
<li>vim (**)
<li>mc (**) [= Norton Commander clone]
</ul>
<b>Archive</b>
<ul>
<li>zip
<li>unzip
</ul>
<b>Net (***)</b>
<ul>
<li>inetutils [contains rsh/rlogin functionality]
<li>openssh [secure replacement for rsh/rlogin]
</ul>
</ul>

Note: You can always re-start the cygwin installation program to add additional
packages later or to update existing packages.<br>
(*) Bison and Flex are required to build OpendTect itself.<br>
(**) You will need an editor that understands unix file format every now and
then. If you're familiar with the good old Norton Commander, you might opt for
mc, but one of the other editors in (editors) should also do.<br>
(***) For cross platform remote batch processing
</p>


<p>After the installation, make sure you run the Cygwin (bash) shell
at least once to make sure that you have a Cygwin home directory to
put your development environment on.</p>

<a name=setup><h2>Setting up the environment</h2></a>

<p> <a href="pmake.html">Pmake</a> is used to build both the system and
plugins. It requires a few environment variables to be setup and it
expects a certain directory structure in your ODWork directory. </p>

<h3>Setup ODWork dir</h3>

<p> Before you can build anything, you have to setup a work directory
(usually called 'ODWork') in such a way that Pmake can use it. The
easiest way to do this is from within OpendTect, menu 'Utilities-Create
Devel Env'. Note that the OpendTect application window will freeze while
the development environment is created. 'Create Devel. Env.' will also
create an init script 'init.bash' in your ODWork directory that can
easily be sourced from your .bashrc to setup your environment. </p>


<p>It is strongly recommended to make sure that there are no spaces in
the path to your ODWork directory. A good place for your ODWork
directory is your cygwin home directory, which is by default at
C:\cygwin\home\[user_name]. The location of this directory can be
easily found from a cygwin bash shell:

<pre>
    cd
    cygpath -w `pwd`
</pre>

</p>

<h3>Setup environment variables</h3>

<p> Now you will have to setup a few environment variables: HDIR, WORK
and GNUMAKE. Fortunately, if you have used the 'Create Devel. Env.' menu
this can be done with one command (see below).

<ul>
<li>HDIR defines the platform you're working on. On windows, this should be set
to win.
<li>GNUMAKE gives the name of gnu make, usually just make or gmake.
<li>WORK defines where your ODWork directory is.
</ul>

Beside setting up these environment variables, you should source either
the PMinit.csh or the PMinit.sh script present in the $WORK/Pmake/base
directory.</p>

<p>All this can be done by sourcing one script (if you have used the
OpendTect menu to setup the $WORK directory): 'init.bash' (or
'init.csh',if you work with the non-default csh shell). It seems logical
to add the relevant script to your .bashrc (or.login for C-shell users).
And, if you have created your ODWork directory in your cygwin home, the
line to add to the end of your .bashrc script could look like:

<pre>
    source ~/ODWork/init.bash
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Building your own plugins</h3>

<h4>Testing the installation</h4>

<p> After you setup your environment, open a new cygwin bash shell and
go to your ODWork directory (You can start a bash shell from the Windows
start menu). If all is well, the alias 'cdw' should bring you directly
to your ODWork  directory. Then go to the plugins directory and type
'make'. You should see something like this:

<pre>
$ cd plugins/
$ make
make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/plugins/Hello'
  Making Hello / Microsoft Windows (Nov 27 13:18:33) DEBUG=no.
Compiling hellopi.cc ...
Ranlib on Hello.lib ...
Creating /cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/lib/win/O/Hello.dll ...
  Done !
make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/plugins/Hello'

&lt;snip&gt;

make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/plugins/uiSeisIOSimple'
  Making uiSeisIOSimple / Microsoft Windows (Nov 27 13:19:14) DEBUG=no.
Compiling seisiosimple.cc ...
Compiling uiseisiosimple.cc ...
Compiling uiseisiosimplepi.cc ...
Ranlib on uiSeisIOSimple.lib ...
Creating /cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/lib/win/O/uiSeisIOSimple.dll
 ...
  Done !
make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/Administrator/ODWork/plugins/uiSeisIOSimple'
$</pre>
</p>

<p> The libraries should now be ready in $WORK/lib/win. We can check
that, like this:

<pre>
$ cdw
$ cd lib/win/
$ ls
Coh.dll*    O@                 libuiSeisIOSimple.dll.a*  uiSeisIOSimple.dll*
Coh.lib*    libCoh.dll.a*      uiCoh.dll*                uiSeisIOSimple.lib*
G@          libHello.dll.a*    uiCoh.lib*
Hello.dll*  libuiCoh.dll.a*    uiHello.dll*
Hello.lib*  libuiHello.dll.a*  uiHello.lib*
$
</pre>
</p>

<p> 
If anything goes wrong during compile and/or link, the error
messages are sent to a file 'lswin' in the source directory. If you
want to see these immediately on the command line, set the environment
variable OUTSTDOUT to yes, e.g. in your init.bash file:

<pre>export OUTSTDOUT=yes</pre>
you can also add this for each make run, then type:
<pre>make OUTSTDOUT=yes</pre>
</p>


<h4>Testing the newly compiled plugins</h4>

<p>
You can test your newly compiled plugins by loading them using the
Utilities-plugins menu in OpendTect. For example, if you load the "Hello.dll"
plugin, you should see "Hello World" on the OpendTect console window. Notes:
<ul>

<li>For some reason the manual loading of plugins can fail on the very
first attempt with an error message from windows that it is not able
to find the plugin. Maybe someone with knowledge about the dark
corners of Windows can explain us why. In any case, if you try again
it works. </li>

<li>If you want to load one of the 'ui' plugins, you have to load the
corresponding non-ui one first. </li>

<li>You cannot re-load a plugin. Even more so: once loaded, the DLL
remains locked by windows until you exit OpendTect. Thus, if you
change any code you'd better exit OpendTect before trying to re-build
the plugin. If you don't exit OpendTect you'll get an error message
like: 'cannot overwrite .... Permission denied'. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<a name=installplugins><h4>Installing your plugins</h4>

<p> 'Installing' a plugin would be making the plugin auto-load at
OpendTect startup. Basically, this is done by copying the plugin to
the correct plugin subdirectory in either your personal '.od' settings
directory or in the program installation directory. After that, you
need to create a new ".alo" file, or add the plugin to an existing
".alo" file.  The procedure is the same on Unix and Windows, so please
consult the plugins <a href="plugins.html#autoload">auto-load and
installation</a> documentation for more details. </p>

<p> There are a few remarks about the location of your personal
directory on windows though. Your 'Personal directory' is located at
$HOME if this is defined, which is normally taken care of by the
cygwin tcsh shell. Otherwise, the location of $USERPROFILE or
eventually $APPDATA is used. This takes place in the
"bin/init_dtect_user" script, which sets the environment variable
"DTECT_SETTINGS" which on its turn is used internally in OpendTect,
unless overridden by "DTECT_WINSETTINGS"</p>

<p> If you want your personal '.od' settings directory to be somewhere
else, you can set the "DTECT_WINHOME" and or the "DTECT_WINSETTINGS"
environment variable. The first overrides $HOME and thus also 
specifies a new location for the '.od' settings directory; the latter
specifies the '.od' directory itself -- you should even be able to
give it another name, although this is not recommended.</p>

<p> You can set environment variables using  "My Computer - properties
- advanced - Environment Variables", but you can also edit the
start_dtect.bat file or a copy of it.</p>

<br>

<a name=dist><h2>Distributing your plugins:</h2>

<p> The distribution of plugins is basically the same for Unix and
windows.  Just copy the .alo files into the plugins/platform directory    
(<code>$DTECT_APPL/plugins/$HDIR</code>, default <code>C:\Program
Files\OpendTect\plugins\win</code> on windows) and copy the actual
plugins into the libs subdirectory. </p>


<p> In order to do this, we use .tar.gz files on Unix and inno-setup on
windows, which can be obtained for free at:  <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">jrsoftware.org</a>. </p>

<p> Because we internally treat Windows as much like Unix as we can, we
actually make a .tar.gz file for our windows plugins too, which is
extracted to "d:\users\admin\rel\plugins\opendtect-3.2\", which forms
the "Source" for Inno-Setup. </p>

<p> As an example, here is the Inno-setup file "dgbsetup.iss" that we
use for our own dgb plugins. Note that the OpendTect installation
directory is stored in the registry and used as 'DefaultDirName':</p>

<a name=buildod><h2>Building OpendTect</h2>

<p> Building the entire OpendTect system from source is not a task for
the weak at heart and it is not supported. Still, it may be useful were
it only for the purpose of getting insight in the various modules. </p>

<p> OpendTect relies on a number of external libraries to function.  All
these external libraries have been properly insulated, so on Unix there
should be no need to recompile these if you just want to rebuild some
parts of OpendTect, unless you want to rebuild one of the  uiBase,
uiCoin or visBase modules. </p>

<p> However, unlike on Unix, you cannot rebuild but the most basic
modules on Windows without recompiling Qt, Coin and SoQt, because beside
header files Windows also requires import libraries for the dlls to be
available when linking. Since we are not allowed to redistribute some of
these import libraries, you will have to build Qt, Coin and SoQt
yourself which requires two versions of the gcc compiler, a pthread
library and some tinkering with config files. </p>

<p> Therefore, if you want to build OpendTect from scratch, we would
like to suggest building a Linux version. Both Qt and Coin are freely
available and build out of the box on Linux, there's no need for two gcc
compilers and there is also no need for a separate pthread library. </p>

<p> Should you really want to build OpendTect on Windows, read on for
some guidelines. </p>

<h3>Qt</h3>
Download Windows MinGW package from the <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/appdev/platform/qt-for-windows"> Qt website </a>. Our development and stable release are build using <a href="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.3.5-mingw.exe"> Qt 4.3.5 </a>. Follow the step in the installer. If you don't have a MinGW installation yet, tick 'Download and install minimal MinGW installation' in one of the installer steps. 


<h3>Pthreads</h3>

<p> The pthreads-win32 library can be downloaded from  <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/">
http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/</a>. You also might want to
check out the faq:  <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/faq.html">http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/faq.html</a>
</p>

<p> You need to copy the include files into cygwin's mingw include
directory (default C:\cygwin\usr\include\mingw), the proper dll
(pthreadGC.dll) into  the bin directory (default C:\cygwin\bin) and the
accompaning import library (libpthreadGC.a) into the mingw lib directory
(default C:\cygwin\lib\mingw) </p>

<h3>Coin and friends</h3>

<p>Coin does not officially support anything other then VC++ on Windows.
However, older versions of Coin required cygwin as a build environment. 
This was necessary in order to make use of the command-line MSVC
compiler, cl.exe, which was called using a wrapper program (wrapmsvc).
</p>

<p> Note that it is required to compile Coin (and SoQt) with the
-mno-cygwin switch, which prevents linking to the cygwin dll. Without it
you cannot link with Qt because that is linked to the the native Windows
c libraries, which are not compatible with the cygwin c libraries. (You
might be able to link with the GPL-ed X11 version of Qt under cygwin,
but that requires you to run an X-server such as cygwin/Xfree86.  See:
<a href="http://kde-cygwin.sourceforge.net/">kde-cygwin</a>. ). </p>

<p> One more note: The cygwin-MinGW distribution, which is what is
actually used when using the -mno-cygwin switch, contains some .la files
that have bogus directories in them. These files are located in
/lib/mingw and should either be edited by hand to contain the correct
values or should be deleted.  </p>
