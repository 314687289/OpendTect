<a name=external><h2>External installations</h2></a>

<p> The external installations can, in principle, be installed wherever
you like. </p>


<h3>Visual Studio 8</h3>

<p>OpendTect is build with Visual Studio 8. Although we're using a commercial
version, the Visual Studio Express edition, should also get you started. Make
sure you have installed the latest updates from Microsoft.</p>

<h3>Vim editor</h3>
<p>Visual Studio comes with it's own editor. For real coding, vim is still superiour and is our preferred editor. The Windows version can be downloaded from:
http://www.vim.org/ </p>


<h3>Qt</h3>
A Qt installation is only necessary when you want to build a plugin which is directly dependend on Qt. Download Windows Qt package from the <a href="http://qtsoftware.com/"> Qt website </a>. 


<h3>Coin and friends</h3>
<p>A full Coin installation is only necessary when you want to build a plugin which is directly dependend on Coin. Download Windows Coin, SoQt and SIMVoleon packages from <a href="http://coin3d.org/">Coin website </a>. Or get the source code from <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net">subversion</a> and build yourself using Visual Studio.</p>
<br>

<a name=setup><h3>Setup ODWork dir</h3>

<p> Before you can build anything, you have to setup a work directory
(usually called 'ODWork'). The easiest way to do this is from within
OpendTect, menu 'Utilities-Tools-Create
Devel Env'. Note that the OpendTect application window will freeze while
the development environment is created. </p>


<h3>Setup environment variables</h3>

<p> Now you will have to setup at least one environment variables: WORK.
Right-click on 'My Computer', select Properties, Advanced tab and click on the button 'Environment variables'. Add a new variable WORK and set its value to the directory created by the 'Create Devel Env' tool.
If you're using Qt and/or Coin, you'll have to set QTDIR and COINDIR likewise.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Building your own plugins</h3>

<h4>Testing the installation</h4>

<p> After you setup your environment, goto the plugins\msvc8 folder and open the Tutorial solution. When openened, build the solution from the Build menu, the toolbar, or the Solution right-click menu.</p>

<p> The libraries should now be ready in $WORK\plugins\msvc8\Win32\debug|release.
</p>


<h4>Testing the newly compiled plugins</h4>

<p>
You can test your newly compiled plugins by loading them using the
Utilities-plugins menu in OpendTect. For example, if you load the "Hello.dll"
plugin, you should see "Hello World" on the OpendTect console window. Notes:
<ul>

<li>For some reason the manual loading of plugins can fail on the very
first attempt with an error message from windows that it is not able
to find the plugin. Maybe someone with knowledge about the dark
corners of Windows can explain us why. In any case, if you try again
it works. </li>

<li>If you want to load one of the 'ui' plugins, you have to load the
corresponding non-ui one first. </li>

<li>You cannot re-load a plugin. Even more so: once loaded, the DLL
remains locked by windows until you exit OpendTect. Thus, if you
change any code you'd better exit OpendTect before trying to re-build
the plugin. If you don't exit OpendTect you'll get an error message
like: 'cannot overwrite .... Permission denied'. </li>

<li>By default Visual Studio creates the "Debug" versions of the Dlls which cannot be directly loaded in to OpendTect. If you want to load your plugin in OpendTect, change the project configuration to release and build your code in release mode, now it will be possible to load the plugin. </li>


</ul>
</p>
<br>

<a name=installplugins><h4>Installing your plugins</h4>

<p> 'Installing' a plugin would be making the plugin auto-load at
OpendTect startup. Basically, this is done by copying the plugin to
the correct plugin subdirectory in either your personal '.od' settings
directory or in the program installation directory. After that, you
need to create a new ".alo" file, or add the plugin to an existing
".alo" file.  The procedure is the same on Unix and Windows, so please
consult the plugins <a href="plugins.html#autoload">auto-load and
installation</a> documentation for more details. </p>

<p> There are a few remarks about the location of your personal
directory on windows though. Your 'Personal directory' is located at
$HOME if this is defined, which is normally taken care of by the
cygwin tcsh shell. Otherwise, the location of $USERPROFILE or
eventually $APPDATA is used. This takes place in the
"bin/init_dtect_user" script, which sets the environment variable
"DTECT_SETTINGS" which on its turn is used internally in OpendTect,
unless overridden by "DTECT_WINSETTINGS"</p>

<p> If you want your personal '.od' settings directory to be somewhere
else, you can set the "DTECT_WINHOME" and or the "DTECT_WINSETTINGS"
environment variable. The first overrides $HOME and thus also 
specifies a new location for the '.od' settings directory; the latter
specifies the '.od' directory itself -- you should even be able to
give it another name, although this is not recommended.</p>

<p> You can set environment variables using  "My Computer - properties
- advanced - Environment Variables", but you can also edit the
start_dtect.bat file or a copy of it.</p>

<br>

<a name=dist><h2>Distributing your plugins:</h2>

<p> The distribution of plugins is basically the same for Unix and
windows.  Just copy the .alo files into the plugins/platform directory    
(<code>$DTECT_APPL/plugins/$HDIR</code>, default <code>C:\Program
Files\OpendTect\plugins\win</code> on windows) and copy the actual
plugins into the libs subdirectory. </p>


<p> In order to do this, we use .tar.gz files on Unix and inno-setup on
windows, which can be obtained for free at:  <a
href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">jrsoftware.org</a>. </p>

<p> Because we internally treat Windows as much like Unix as we can, we
actually make a .tar.gz file for our windows plugins too, which is
extracted to "d:\users\admin\rel\plugins\opendtect-4.x.y\", which forms
the "Source" for Inno-Setup. </p>

<p> As an example, here is the Inno-setup file "dgbsetup.iss" that we
use for our own dgb plugins. Note that the OpendTect installation
directory is stored in the registry and used as 'DefaultDirName':</p>

<a name=buildod><h2>Building OpendTect</h2></a>
<p>
OpendTect solution and OpendTect plugins solution can be found in $WORK\msvc8. From these solutions it should be quite easy to build OpendTect from scratch. Note that it requires an installation of Qt, Coin and FFTW. The currently used versions can be found in: $DTECT_APPL\doc\ReleaseInfo\RELEASEINFO.txt
