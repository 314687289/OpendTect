<h1>OpendTect Hardware and OS requirements</h1>
<h2>Supported platforms</h2>

OpendTect runs on 3 hardware platforms:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>/<a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD</a> under Linux (32 or 64 bits) or MS Windows (2000 and XP)
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>/Sparc under Solaris 8 or up
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/dotmac">Mac</a>/PowerPC under OS X (10.4.4) and up
</ol>


<h2>Hardware requirements</h2>

<h3>Graphics:</h3>

OpendTect requires a recent well-patched <a href="http://opengl.org">OpenGL</a> installation. OpenGL drivers should be updated at least every half year to ensure optimal performance and compliance.
<br><br>
<b>Intel/AMD:</b> Recent <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">nVidia</a> and <a href="http://www.amd.com">AMD (ATI)</a> graphics cards/chipsets. Well behaved are nVidia GeForce 6, 7 and 8 series and AMD (ATI) Radeon X1xx and X2xx series.<br>
<b>Mac/PowerPC:</b>Similar to te Intel/AMD platform.<br>
<b>Sun/Sparc:</b> Graphics cards like the XVR 2500 or better.<br>
<br>
Main stream and high-end GPUs within the series are recommended, since low-level GPUs keep showing poor performances through the generations.<br>
Since OpendTect 3.0, shading functionaly requires special GPU features, present in the cards listed above.
Nevertheless, under Linux environment, only nVidia provides drivers capabilities to use the shading feature (latest so far are 100.14 drivers).

<h3>Memory</h3>

OpendTect should at least have 1 GB internal (RAM) memory available.
Depending on the size of the surveys we recommend 4-8 GB on average. In
special cases (big surveys or many data cubes) more memory may be required.
<br>
A rule of thumb is to have at least 10 times the displayed number of samples available. Thus, to be able to display 10 inlines with 2000 crosslines and 1000 samples per trace, you'll need a minimum of 200 million bytes of memory (i.e. 200 MB).


<h3>Processor</h3>

For Linux and MS Windows, a modern Intel or AMD processor is required.
Although OpendTect will run on 2 GHz processors or even less, we
recommend 3 GHz dual core for a good working environment.<br>
The Solaris/Sparc platform performs a lot less; therefore, only high end
processors like the Sun ultraSPARC IIIi and up will give tolerable
performance.


<h2>Operating systems</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

A modern Linux distribution is required. <b>Minimum</b>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.novell.com/linux">SuSE</a> 10.0
<li><a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> Enterprise 3
<li><a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> core 3
</ul>
For both SuSE and Red Hat-based distributions 32 or 64 bits releases are
available. OpendTect is known to work under <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and other distributions, as well as earlier versions of the main distributions, too.

<h3>Solaris</h3>

Solaris 8 and up are supported.

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

Minimum is Mac OS X (10.4.4). Mac/Intel is not supported at this point in time.

<h3>MS Windows</h3>
Windows 2000 and XP are supported. During 2007 Windows Vista compliance
will be achieved.
