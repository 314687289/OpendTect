<H1>The OpendTect Installation Manager</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>OpendTect has a utility to create and manage multiple installations of the OpendTect system. It takes care of initial installation, extensions, and upgrade/update. This 'OpendTect Installation Manager' will upgrade itself when necessary.</p>
<p>The Installation Manager can be installed in the usual way for your Operating System. After download from <a href="http://opendtect.org">opendtect.org</a> you need to execute the self-extracting installer. This can usually be done by double-clicking on the downloaded executable package.

<BR><BR>

<H2>Starting from within OpendTect</H2>
<p>Once OpendTect is installed it is possible to start the Installation Manager from within the OpendTect main window. That is, if your system administion allow it. And actual application management can of course only be done if you have the right permissions.

Starting Window</H2>
<p>
The starting window of the installation manager allows you to setup some basic parameters before the actual package/plugin selection starts.
</p><p><A NAME="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.BASEDIR"></A><A NAME="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.PACKAGESEL"></A><A NAME="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.DOWNLOADFAILED"></A><A NAME="LINK-UTILITIES.INSTALLATION.MANAGER.PACKAGE"></A>
<IMG SRC="pics/fig-UTILITIES_004.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=203 BORDER=0>
</p><p>
The field for <I>Release Type</I> usually selects between 'Stable' and 'Development' releases.  The <I>installation base directory</I> is the directory where the OpendTect versions will reside. It can contain multiple releases and release types, and will also contain the latest installation manager executables.
</p><p>
This directory will be remembered. If you initially select an exisiting non-empty directory, then you get this warning message:
</p><p>

</p><p>
If you want to install into a sub-directory of the selected path, then the
second option must be selected. It will create a sub-directory
&quot;OpendTect&quot; at where the installation itself will reside.<BR>
</p><p>After this, if this is a first time, you can select typical package setups.
