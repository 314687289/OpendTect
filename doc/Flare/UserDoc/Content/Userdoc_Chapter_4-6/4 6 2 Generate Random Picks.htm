        <h3 class="Heading2">4.6.2. Generate Random Picks (3D)</h3>
        <p>Random picks are very important especially for prediction purposes or object detection. These are defined specifically for unsupervised neural network training (see dGB Plugin documentation for more details). Unsupervised waveform segmentation (UVQ*) is one of them. The window is launched from the tree element <span class="span_1">Pickset/Polygon &gt; (right click) &gt; New Pickset &gt; Generate 3D...</span>. The following window pops up. <br /><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/Userdoc_Chapter_4-6/03000005.png" style="height: 423px;width: 354px;" class="img_1" /><br /><span class="span_1">Random (3D) pickset creation window</span><br /><br />In this window write an appropriate name for the picks and select a distinct color. <span class="span_1">The generate location by</span> contains several options: Range, Polygon, Table, and Surface. It generates random picks within a selected range of inlines/crosslines/time, polygon, table, at a surface, or between two surfaces. Select and fill rest fields that are according to the selection in <span class="span_1">the generate locations by...</span> option.<br /><br />Optionally, a rejection filter can also be applied by selecting <span class="span_1">Remove locations</span>. It passes each random position according to a selected filter (random, polygon, subsample, table or surface). It is useful to avoid random picks in unwanted regions e.g. by providing a polygon.<br /><br />Provide the maximum number of locations to be inserted in the bottom text field. Fill an appropriate random number. Press OK to insert random picks.<br /><br />* <span class="span_2">Note:</span> UVQs are explained in Neural Network section of the plugin documentation.</p>
