Bernd Fiebig of <a href="http://www.addaxpetroleum.com">AddaxPetroleum </a> saw the need for a post-stack multiple removal capability in OpendTect.
The type of multiple removal algorithm chosen for this application was the well known least squares prediction error filter, a.k.a "Gap Decon". This filter aims to flatten a user defined part of an auto-correlation function.
