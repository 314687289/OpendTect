        <h3 class="Heading2">4.6.3. Generate Random Picks (2D)</h3>
        <p>Random picks for the 2D data can also be used for the same purposes as that for random picks for 3D (read previous section). The pickset creation window for 2D random picks can be launched from the tree element <span class="span_1">Pickset/Polygon &gt; (right click) &gt; New Pickset&gt; Generate 2D...</span> sub menu. It will launch the following pickset creation window. <br /><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/Userdoc_Chapter_4-6/03000006.png" style="height: 440px;width: 464px;" class="img_1" /><br /><br />In this window fill/select the fields for name, a color, the number of (random) picks to be generated, on a specific lineset(/lines), geometry and Z-range. It may be noted that the specified random picks are generated according to the given geometry. The geometry is defined by a Z-range/ horizon(s). It depends upon the purpose/objective. For instance, if the objective is to detect facies by using random vectors (picks) on a surface, then horizon geometry shall be provided. Similarly, random picks can also be defined between two horizons on the selected lines.</p>
